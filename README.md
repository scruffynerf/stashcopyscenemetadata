Get the SCENE ID of the scene you are copying FROM:
You will need either the scene ID, or the scene URL (for ease of copy and paste)

Visit the scene page of the scene you want to copy INTO:

Past the ID/URL from the FROM into the URL field of the scene

SAVE!  We have no way to pass this along otherwise, it must be saved first.

Now select Select With... and pick Copy Metadata from Scene to Scene
it will scrape your old scene, and offer you the info just like a normal scrape
